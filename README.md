# IOT-based-Smart-Agriculture-Monitoring-System

This project aims to empower farmers with real-time environmental data (temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and soil temperature) for efficient monitoring and enhanced crop yield and quality. Leveraging the power of the Internet of Things (IoT), this system utilizes NodeMCU, a powerful microcontroller, to collect data from various sensors:

- DHT11 Sensor: Measures temperature and humidity.
- Moisture Sensor: Monitors soil moisture levels.
- DS18B20 Sensor Probe: Tracks soil temperature.
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor): Detects ambient light conditions.
- Water Pump: Provides automated irrigation based on soil moisture readings.
- 12V LED Strip: Offers targeted illumination for specific stages of plant growth.

Upon activation, the system gathers environmental data and transmits it securely to the IoT cloud for real-time monitoring and analysis. This empowers farmers to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, maximizing crop yield and ensuring optimal product quality.
Additionally, the system features automated irrigation capabilities, utilizing the water pump to maintain ideal soil moisture levels, further streamlining farm operations and resource utilization.
